Hi, I'm @dstorer2. I'm interested in angular and react native frontend development. I'm currently learning CI/CD deployment to an AWS EC2 instance.
I'm currently working on an app I'm calling The Agency. It's a real world game much like Street Wars:

It's a real world water gun assasination game. Would love to collaborate. I'm not as versed on the backend side of things,
so help on that would be very welcome!
